    "Link to data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e (** this file maybe too big for github, please not that when downloading the data it is filtered for only entries for fiscal year 2018**)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a dataset from the Office of Payroll Administration (OPA). In a csv format, it gives the name, department, title, and pay (both regular and overtime) for city employees for NYC (which accounts for most of the major public service departments). It is payroll data for the fiscal end of 2018 and was last updates 9/28/18. This data has been public since 2015. Though it does not say, this data is most likely kept and stored as public record by the OPA, which processes and delivers payroll to the 300k+ city employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up in NYC, with what seems like a tremendous amount of public services, I believe that this data set will allow me to learn a bit more about how the city operates. More specifically, it may help me appreciate some services over others. With this dataset, I hope to see where the city is putting its money and manpower, which payroll seems to be a good indicator of. Using this dataset, we can see what is important and, in a sense, most valuable to the city. In addition, we may also be able to see if any dept seems to be over- or underpaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few questions I hope to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the average salary per hour by department (top 10) and what has the most total payroll?\n",
    "What are the average number of hours (regular and overtime) worked for each department (top 10)?\n",
    "Which departments have the most manpower (top 10) and where is that manpower mainly concentrated (top 10)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fiscal year: the reporting year (integer)\n",
    "- Payroll number: an identifier for the dept (integer)\n",
    "- Agency name: the department for the individual employee (string)\n",
    "- Last Name (string)\n",
    "- First Name (string)\n",
    "- Mid Initial (character)\n",
    "- Agency Start - when did the employee start working (string)\n",
    "- Work Location - where does the employee work (string)\n",
    "- Title Description - what is the employees job (string)\n",
    "- Leave Status - is the employee still working there (string)\n",
    "- Base Salary (float)\n",
    "- Pay Basis - is the base salary per hour, per year, etc. (string)\n",
    "- Regular Hours - hours before overtime accounted for (float)\n",
    "- Regular Gross Paid - actual amount paid (float)\n",
    "- OT Hours - overtime hours for employee (float)\n",
    "- Total OT Paid - amount for overtime paid, which surprisingly can be negative (float)\n",
    "- Total Other Pay (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems and potential transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, this data is very clean and standardized, but it is tough to see problems given that there are 500k+ rows. Probably the biggest, which will need to be solved, is that some locations are missing and will need to filled in. Not only that, but the pay basis is different. I believe we should only consider full time employees on a per annum basis. Many of the per hour and per day employees are for one off jobs or just work part time from just reading the data. Again, this should allow for normalization. Moreover, many of the employees are not \"active\", meaning ceased or on leave, which I would like to take out to be consistent (also some of the employees are interns and such). I will also remove some columns (specifically fiscal year, middle initial, and agency start) that are irrelevant to my analysis."

    "Answers to my questions:\n",
    "Based on my analysis, the means for the full time employees were heavily skewed by a few outliers. Judging by the differences between the mean and median, median tended to be the better metric to use to understand the total value and work done by city employees. As seen by the data, the highest median hourly pay went to the Manhattan Community Board #8. This board covers the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island Areas. However, this seemed to be a challenging question to answer given the influence of outliers and would most likely need to scrubbed of those entries individually. What I found was that number of employees worked tended to conicide better with total payroll for the city. For both the dept of ed pedalogical had the highest numbers. For hours worked however, the department of sanitation had the most. Interestingly the differences between the top 10 departments was not relatively different, as compared to the other statistics calculated. Finally, we see that Manhattan has by far the most workers of any borough or surrounding county. This makes sense, given the massive infrastructure and population in Manhattan. I was surprised to see more workers in Queens or Brooklyn, however.\n"

    "There are many challenges with work with a dataset, especially stemming from its size. For one, it was hard to catch many of the missing information, such as missing work location or the 0 entries for hours worked. This also made for some probable inaccuracies, since assuming the number of hours worked greatly changes the calculations. In addition, looking at the pay basis, it was hard to distinguish who a full-time employee was as the sheet included all interns, part-timers, etc. for the FY 2018. Finally, I also had challenges with the order in which I would have to clean the data. I found that switching the order could raise errors. "
